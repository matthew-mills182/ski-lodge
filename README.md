# üìã i211 Flask Template

- üìî This is *your* repository, make it your own!
- ‚úèÔ∏è The `README.md` is a place to take notes about your work and workflow
- üìÉ Read below, we've included some notes to get you started

## ‚ö° Quickstart

### MacOS / WSL / Linux / ChromeOS

Clone the repository (replacing `REPO-NAME` with your lecture/project repo):

```bash
git clone https://github.iu.edu/i211sp2025/REPO-NAME.git
```

```bash
cd REPO-NAME
```

Create a `venv` environment, activate it, and install dependencies with `pip`:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Check that `flask` runs without errors:

```bash
python -m flask --version
```

### PowerShell + Windows (Not Recommended)

<details>
<summary>Why is this Not Recommended?</summary>

> Our goal is to build web applications that run in a Unix-like environment. Accomplishing this goal is easiest when we can *develop* and *deploy* to Unix-like environments.
>
> Microsoft Windows has a different set of *development tools* (shells, compilers) and an architecture which, for historical reasons, is quite different from the Unix-like operating systems that >98% of the Internet run on.
>
> Covering "how to develop for the Windows platform" is therefore mostly a topic for another time. We only recommend this if:
>
> - You already have experience with the Windows development ecosystem
> - You are comfortable with Unix environments from previous experience, and are comfortable translating between Windows and Unix
> - You have an older Windows environment that is incompatible with WSL

</details>

<details>
<summary>Create a venv environment, activate it, and install requirements.</summary>

> ```powershell
> python -m venv venv
> .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Execution Policy</strong>: Do you see a red permissions error when activating the environment?</summary>

> You might need to set the execution policy on your machine. This should only need to be done once:
>
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
> ```

</details>

## üèÉ Start a Development Server

Make sure your environment is activated. You should see a `(venv)` in the terminal if it is:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

The default package name is `flaskapp`. Running the package as a module `-m` starts the server on http://localhost:5000

```bash
python -m flaskapp
```

Alternatively, starting with "*Run and Debug*" in Visual Studio Code (<kbd>F5</kbd>) will also start the server in debug mode.

<details>
<summary><strong>Debugging</strong>: Does VS Code tell you "No module named flask"?</summary>

> Assuming you already installed dependencies with:
>
> ```bash
> source venv/bin/activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```
>
> It's possible that Visual Studio Code is not locating the `venv` environment. You can set the Python interpreter in VS Code by opening the command palette (<kbd>^ Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>‚áß Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>, or: <kbd>‚åò Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>‚áß Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and typing `Python: Select Interpreter`. Then select the `venv` environment.
>
> The slightly more manual approach is to open the VS Code terminal, activate the `venv` environment, and start `flaskapp`:
>
> ```bash
> source venv/bin/activate
> python -m flaskapp
> ```
>
> This might mean we need to recreate the `venv` environment. If the Python extension is not finding an interpreter, it can be a sign that there is a compatibility issue with the environment (see also: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_working-with-python-interpreters).

## üöÄ Deploy

### First-time Deploy

`ssh` into silo, replacing `USERNAME` with your IU username:

```bash
ssh USERNAME@silo.luddy.indiana.edu
```

Clone the project/lecture repositories, replacing `USERNAME` with your IU username.

```bash
git clone https://github.iu.edu/i211sp2025/USERNAME-i211-lecture.git ~/cgi-pub/i211-lecture
```

```bash
git clone https://github.iu.edu/i211sp2025/USERNAME-i211-project.git ~/cgi-pub/i211-project
```

### Subsequent Deploys

After `git` repositories are set up, you can deploy changes using `ssh`:

```bash
ssh USERNAME@silo.luddy.indiana.edu
cd ~/cgi-pub/i211-lecture
git restore .
git pull
```

```bash
ssh USERNAME@silo.luddy.indiana.edu
cd ~/cgi-pub/i211-project
git restore .
git pull
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Check your work

Once deployed, your changes should immediately be visible:

- https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~USERNAME/i211-lecture/
- https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~USERNAME/i211-project/

## üêõ Debugging in Production

Did you deploy your app and get a generic "500 Internal Server Error" when testing your site? The debugger is your best bet:

- [CGI Production Debugger](https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~hayesall/cgi-production-debugger/)

When an error occurs: messages are appended to a `/var/log/apache2/error.log` file. The "Debugger" helps you read and search that file.

1. Refresh your app, e.g.: https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~USERNAME/i211-project/
2. Refresh the page in the debugger: https://cgi.luddy.indiana.edu/~hayesall/cgi-production-debugger/
3. Search for your IU username
4. The most-recent (top) message is probably the most relevant

### Common Operations

Logging into `silo`:

```bash
ssh USERNAME@silo.luddy.indiana.edu
```

Debugging cgi errors:

```bash
ssh USERNAME@silo.luddy.indiana.edu
ssh USERNAME@cgi.luddy.indiana.edu
less +F /var/log/apache2/error.log
```

Logging into MariaDB (replace USER/PASSWORD/DATABASE):

```bash
mysql -h db.luddy.indiana.edu -u USER --password=PASSWORD -D DATABASE
```
